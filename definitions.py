This module provides definitions for various mathematical terms and properties.
It contains a dictionary mapping property names to their detailed definitions and functions
to retrieve the names and definitions. These definitions are used in the MathBook application
to educate users about different mathematical concepts.

                        "of those factors is also a perfect number. For example, 12 is sublime because it has six positive "

    "Abundant numbers": ("A positive integer is abundant if the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. "
                         "The difference is known as the abundance."),
    "Deficient numbers": ("A deficient number is a positive integer for which the sum of its proper divisors is less than the "
